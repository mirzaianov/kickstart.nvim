  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to automatically pass options to a plugin's `setup()` function, forcing the plugin to be loaded.
  --
  -- Alternatively, use `config = function() ... end` for full control over the configuration.
  -- If you prefer to call `setup` explicitly, use:
  --    {
  --        'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
  --        config = function()
  --            require('gitsigns').setup({
  --                -- Your gitsigns configuration here
  --            })
  --        end,
  --    }

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.

  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

  -- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-🔌-plugin-spec`
  -- Or use telescope!
  -- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
  -- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
